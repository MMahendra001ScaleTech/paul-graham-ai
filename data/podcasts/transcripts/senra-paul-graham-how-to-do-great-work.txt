(2:00) All you need to do is find something you have an aptitude for and great interest in.
(2:10) Doing great work means doing something important so well that you expand people's ideas of what's possible.
(4:15) How many even discover something they love to work on? A few hundred thousand, perhaps, out of billions.  —How to Do What You Love by Paul Graham
(5:10) Always preserve excitingness. (Let what you are excited about guide you)
(8:15) If you're excited about some possibility that everyone else ignores, and you have enough expertise to say precisely what they're all overlooking, that's as good a bet as you'll find.
(9:15) How To Work Hard by Paul Graham
(10:05) When you follow what you are intensely interested in this strange convergence happens where you're working all the time and it feels like you're never working.
(10:20) You can't tell what most kinds of work are like except by doing them. You may have to work at something for years before you know how much you like it or how good you are at it.
(13:00) When it comes to figuring out what to work on, you're on your own.
(14:00) Lighting Out for the Territory: How Samuel Clemens Headed West and Became Mark Twain by Roy Morris Jr. (Founders #312)
(17:15) One sign that you're suited for some kind of work is when you like even the parts that other people find tedious or frightening.
(17:50) Make what you are most excited about.
(19:00) If you're interested, you're not astray.
(19:30) Against the Odds: An Autobiography by James Dyson (Founders #300)
(20:15) At each stage do whatever seems most interesting and gives you the best options for the future. I call this approach "staying upwind." This is how most people who've done great work seem to have done it.
(22:50) In many projects a lot of the best work happens in what was meant to be the final stage.
(25:00) A Mathematician’s Apology by G.H. Hardy
(26:00) Great work usually entails spending what would seem to most people an unreasonable amount of time on a problem.
(26:30) The reason we're surprised is that we underestimate the cumulative effect of work. Writing a page a day doesn't sound like much, but if you do it every day you'll write a book a year. That's the key: consistency. People who do great things don't get a lot done every day. They get something done, rather than nothing.
(27:10) Something that grows exponentially can become so valuable that it's worth making an extraordinary effort to get it started.
(27:30) Taylor Swift (Acquired’s Version)
(30:00) If you don't try to be the best, you won't even be good. This observation has been made by so many people in so many different fields that it might be worth thinking about why it's true.
(36:00) Originality isn't a process, but a habit of mind. Original thinkers throw off new ideas about whatever they focus on.
(38:00) Change breaks the brittle.
(43:45) What might seem to be merely the initial step — deciding what to work on — is in a sense the key to the whole game.
(45:00) Being prolific is underrated. + Examples of outlandishly prolific people
(48:30) Just focus on the really important things and ignore everything else.
(50:30) One of the most powerful kinds of copying is to copy something from one field into another. History is so full of chance discoveries of this type that it's probably worth giving chance a hand by deliberately learning about other kinds of work. You can take ideas from quite distant fields if you let them be metaphors.
(51:30) Seek out the best colleagues.
(54:30) Solving hard problems will always involve some backtracking.
(56:30) Don't marry someone who doesn't understand that you need to work, or sees your work as competition for your attention. If you're ambitious, you need to work; it's almost like a medical condition; so someone who won't let you work either doesn't understand you, or does and doesn't care.
(57:50) The prestige of a type of work is at best a trailing indicator and sometimes completely mistaken. If you do anything well enough, you'll make it prestigious.
(58:00) Curiosity is the best guide. Your curiosity never lies, and it knows more than you do about what's worth paying attention to.
If you asked an oracle the secret to doing great work and the oracle replied with a single word, my bet would be on "curiosity."
The whole process is a kind of dance with curiosity.

“I have listened to every episode released and look forward to every episode that comes out. The only criticism I would have is that after each podcast I usually want to buy the book because I am interested, so my poor wallet suffers.” — Gareth

How to do great work. If you collected lists of techniques for doing great work in a lot of different fields, what would the intersection look like? I decided to find out the following recipe assumes you're very ambitious. The first step is to decide what to work on. The work you choose needs to have 3 qualities. Number one, it has to be something you have a natural aptitude for. Number two, you have to have a deep interest in it. And number three, it offers the scope to do great work. In practice, you don't have to worry much about the third criteria.
All you need to do is find something you have an aptitude for and a great interest in. And right away, we get to one of Paul's first footnotes. He says, doing great work means doing something important so well that you expand people's ideas of what's possible, but there's no threshold for importance. That's something he's going to repeat many times in different ways throughout the essays. So you just keep that idea in mind. There's no threshold for importance.
